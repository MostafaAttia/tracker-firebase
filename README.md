# Tracker

Simple time tracker for tasks built with Angular 6 and Firebase.

## Run Locally

1- `git clone git@github.com:MostafaAttia/tracker-firebase.git`

2- `npm install`

3- `ng serve -o`

## Task Details

* I spent about 10-12 hours in total for both versions, divided on days as my spare time.

* I used Lumen Micro-Framework as the task is simple for the backend and doesn't require the whole framework (Laravel) to do it.

* At the beginning, I thought of using pausable rxjs Observables to pause/resume the tracker and stay counting in background, but I think no one need to run multiple tasks at the same time.
